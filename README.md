## [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog)

[example](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/new-features-in-v1#analytics
)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. Version 2
is based on Next App directory
with [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and
uses [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage markdown content.

Probably the most feature-rich Next.js markdown blogging template out there. Easily configurable and customizable.
Perfect as a replacement to existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs.
